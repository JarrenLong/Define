======================
What Is It?
======================
The z80 Assembly Instruction Dictionary is a small,
(well, not yet) program that can be used to look up
important information about all of the z80 ASM
instructions including: syntax, clocks, size, and
what each instruction is for.

======================
Using The Dictionary
======================
When you open up Define.exe, you will see two white
windows, a gray windows with text, and a close button.
The far left windows houses all of the z80 insturctions.
To see the syntax of a certain instruction, click on
that instruction. The white window to the immediate
right will fill up with all of the possible syntaxes
used by that instruction. Again, click on the syntax
that you would like to view. This will fill up the
gray window with a description of the instruction,
the size of it, and how many CPU clocks it takes for
the instruction to complete. When you are done, click
the "Close This Window" button to end the program.
